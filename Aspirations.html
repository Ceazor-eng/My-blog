    My Greatest Aspiration is to be happy wherever i end up,other than that it really doesnt matter
    <br>
    Following the course im currently doing, id like to be a business analyst, though I  know there
    are many positions i can fill, I'll stay open minded.
    <br>
    In my ideal life though, i would love to own a restaurant and not just some local shack, something nice,
    that would attract people from all over.
    <br>
    Last but not least, I will be a real estate mogul eventually after a succesful career.
    <br>
    Yea, kids and a family too
